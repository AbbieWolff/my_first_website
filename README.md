# my_first_website
My first HTML-coded website.

Plans:
--Eventually, this website will be a mixture between a blog and a professional portfolio.
--Content:
  --hobbies (video games, books)
  --causes (feminism, LGBT+, body positivity, mental health awareness, environmentalism, etc.).
  --gallery page(s) showcasing my artwork & photography (sorted by?).
  --portfolio page(s) showcasing my design work (sorted by?).
  --about me (short autobio page with a really vague CV?)
  --hub of all of my public social media activity (YouTube vidoes, tweets, posts, etc.)


I need to make sure this is secure somehow... ??

I am coding this website in a text editor, for now, in phases as part of a semester-long website design project for Hypermedia Design & Authoring class in graduate school. It is not yet ready for public sharing. I am learning how to code as I go.
