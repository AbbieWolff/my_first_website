                Website Plans: I left space above for site navigation links, once I have other pages in the website. I want to make a section of the website specifically about my hobbies/passions, with a page for reading (including a list of my favorite books, authors and genres), a page for video games (this one), and at *least* one page about politics/social issues. Eventually, I'd like to include these "hobby" pages within an overall larger website that features a portfolio of my work (art, design, etc.), contact information, and some way of integrating all of my social media activity in one place within the website.
                Sharing: Once I learn how to, I will be inserting "share" buttons for social networks like Twitter, Facebook & G+ to enable easy sharing of this page, on all pages of this website. That code will probably go somewhere near here, in the header.-->

            <h3>Simulation Games</h3>
                <h4>Young Love</h4>
            <p>I've been playing PC games since I was in elementary school, if <i>4th Grade Adventures</i> and <i>SimTown</i> count. I even loved learning to type with Mavis Beacon, playing typing games in class and at home. Yes, I'm a geek--I know.</p>
            <p>It was a fateful day in junior high school when a friend introduced me to <em><i>The Sims</i></em>. That's when my gaming really started. I could make my own characters, write stories for them, create relationships and design and manage every facet of their lives.</p> 
            <p>I felt inspired to create complicated soap operas with my simulated characters (Sims). Sometimes, I burnt their houses down, or, in later games, trapped them in pools without ladders, just to watch the mayhem unfold. But, mostly, I tried to create something resembling a &quot;happy&quot; life whenever possible, for every Sim.</p>
            <p><i>The Sims</i> (1) was only the beginning for me. As more expansions to and sequels of the game were released, and as the video game development and general computer technology exponentially improved, my love for games expanded in turn.</p>
                <h4>Cities &amp; Towns</h4>
            <p><i>Age of Empires II</i> was, and still is, one of my most cherished simulation games. I still play it, years later, with fondness, despite its age (pun intended). It's a medieval civilization simulation game. The goal is to direct the cultural development and labor and resource management of small medieval towns. Its successor, <i>Age of Empires III</i> and similar games like <i>Banished</i>, are still my go-to games for engaging (yet somewhat mindless) relaxation and escape.</p>
            <p>Similarly, Electronic Arts, the same company that made <i>The Sims</i> games and <i>SimTown</i>, created a modern city simulation series: <i>SimCity</i>.</p> 
            <p>Some of the <i>SimCity</i> games offer the opportunity to expand your city to include <strong>millions</strong> of simulated people--if you don't go bankrupt or have a major catastrophe like an earthquake first!</p> 
            <p><i>Anno 2070</i> is a futuristic city simulation that includes more challenging, social gameplay (with other human beings, no less!) and a more complex resource management system.</p>

        <section title="Role-Playing Games">
            <h3>Role-Playing Games</h3>
            <p>During college, I finally took the plunge and tried playing video games that <em>don't</em> involve simulated, sandbox storytelling (of people or towns/cities).</p>
                <h4>Bioware</h4>
            <p>I fell in love with Bioware at first sight. They tell much better stories than I could on my own, without removing the creativity and power of choice. Bioware games in the <i>Mass Effect</i> and <i>Dragon Age</i> series' tell guided stories with options for dialogue and plot choices that have consequences.</p>
                    <p>The Mass Effect series tells the tale of Commander Shephard, a majestic hero on an epic science fiction adventure with his/her diverse companions as they try to save the universe from itself, and from complete and total destruction--with mixed results. </p>
                    <p>The <i>Dragon Age</i> series explores the medieval world of Thedas with a similarly lovable cast of diverse characters, led by three distinct heroes (one in each game) with varied approaches to resolving civil war, religious persecution, magic, and other exciting conflicts.</p>
                    <p>These <b>role-playing games</b> (RPGs) are story-, character- and culture-focused, with relationship-building (romance and friendship) and world-building (peace and diplomacy) at their core. They are truly <strong>excellent</strong> games, especially the most recent iterations in each series: <i>Mass Effect 3</i> and <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i>. (See the list of my favorite games below for links to the current Dragon Age and Mass Effect websites.)</p>
            </section>

            <section title="New Horizons">
            <h3>New Horizons</h3>
                <p>Bioware opened up so many more options for me as a gamer. After playing through some of their games, for the first time, I felt <strong>capable</strong> of playing games that I had previously associated with "hardcore" (usually male) gamers. I felt capable of handling the controls, combat and strategy required to play games like <i>Skyrim</i>, <i>L.A. Noire</i>, <i>Assassin's Creed 3</i>, and even console games by Quantic Dream.</p>
                <h4>Fear of the Unknown</h4>
                <p>Before playing <i>Mass Effect</i>, I had been very intimidated by RPGs and any other games that were not simulation games, especially if they were not available on PC and required a console. They felt foreign, unfamiliar, and, most importantly (at the time) meant for <strong>boys</strong>--not for me, a girl. </p>
                <p>Despite being surrounded by a family of gamers (my dad and brothers, but not my mom) and being in a long-term relationship with a self-professed hardcore gamer, I felt ostracized from the gaming community for most of my life. It took years for me to move past these mental and social barriers, to accept and then proudly pronounce myself as a female gamer.</p>
                <h4>Free to Play</h4>
                <p>It was ultimately liberating and empowering for me to play through and complete Bioware games, to play as a female character, to form meaningful relationships in-game, and to feel emotionally engaged--instead of <em>disengaged</em>, as I had felt when trying to play many other games.</p>
                <p>I can't wait to continue to expand my horizons with a variety of new games (<i>The Witcher 3</i> and the next <i>Mass Effect</i> game, among others).</p>
                <p>I love simulation games and RPGs.</p>    
                <p>Hopefully, I will eventually have the opportunity to help make games that offer girls and women like me, and the LGBT community I am an ally of, feel <strong>represented</strong> in games.</p>

            <h3>My Favorite Video Games</h3>
                <!--Is the description of the table (shown below in this comment) even necessary or can I take it out completely?...
                <p>Below, I've listed the vast majority of my favorite games. They are organized by 1) PC/Console, 2) Developer (alphabetically), 3) Series, and then 4) date of publication (within a series, oldest to newest). The most recent and/or best games include links to their official websites, in case you'd like to learn 
more about them or their developers.</p>
                <p>In the console games list at the bottom, two of the developers' pages, Quantico and Thatgamecompany, are linked instead of their games because they only make a few games and also are truly admirable, small companies making quality, meaningful games worthy of attention.</p>
                <p>Finally, at the very bottom of the page, you'll find links to my social media pages. Follow me or message me, if you like. I'm on the Web ridiculously often.</p>-->
